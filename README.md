## Problem Statement
The following dataset shows a Portugal bank's marketing campaigns results in an attempt to evaluate the success of the bank's telemarketing. Conducted campaigns seem to be based mostly on direct phone calls, offering bank clients to place a term deposit. Term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, letting banks invest in higher gain financial products in order to make a profit. Additionally, banks also hold a better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. The bank found a possible revenue decline problem upon investigation, where the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Hence, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have a higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing efforts on such clients.
